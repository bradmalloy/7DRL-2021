# 7DRL-2021
7 Day Roguelike challenge, 2021

## Elevator Pitch
This game is a roguelike take on the automation strategy genre.

## Tech
- Typescript
- Pack for web with Browserify
- Deploy & host with Netlify
- rot.js for roguelike tools

## Notes

- Haven't decided on a title yet. Use `$GAME_TITLE` as a placeholder, then we can find/replace later.
- https://animate.style/ (CSS animations - used sparingly, might be nice)
- https://oxal.org/projects/sakura/demo/ (minimal CSS)

### Title Ideas

- Frogue (Factory Rogue, logo is a frog?)
- Factorogue (a little on the nose)
- Rogue Works
- Automatr
- Autorogue
- Automagic (if it ends up magic-themed?)
- Romatic
